# Introduction - 5mn

- Presentation of who we are
- Introduce product management in an Agile/Scrum context .
- Introduce the plan of the course

Let's say that you have an idea for a product that you would like to realise, or bring to the market: How do you get from an idea to a finalised product?

One key problem is that most products require a team of individuals working together to develop and produce the product itself. Product management is a way of standardising the way in which the team interacts while working on a given product. Without product management, teams can work very inefficiently, or problems with a product can be missed, which can be disasterous in the business world.

We're going to explain the concept of product management with reference to a theoretical team of ten people, led by Jane:

**Graphic of the team and interactions between them**

Jane's team work as software developers for InDev Inc., a fictional software consultancy. They don't run InDev, but they exist as a team of people that InDev hires out to develop and produce software products for other companies. InDev has been contracted to produce a smartphone app for another company, SoftInc. Already we can see that there are quite a lot of relationships involved, *product management isn't just about products - it's about people.*

# Concepts and Terminology - 10 Minutes

*I think the first thing we should do here is define "What is a product?" and "How do products relate to projects?" (eg product development as a specific type of project, requiring its own considerations for project management)*

A common mistake is to confuse project management with product management.
To understand what is product management you first need to understand what are the differences between these two fields.

First, we define what is project management.
Then we explain what are the differences between project management and product management.
Finally, we'll see what are the roles of project manager, product manager and product owner.

What we can see is that there is no single definition of a product, but that there are recurring factors involved in the development of most things that can be classed as products. Returning to Jane and InDev, Jane needs to make sure that the product that she has been tasked to develop fits with the client's criteria, but she can also be sure that there will be problems along the way. Jane will likely encounter situations where she needs to make a choice that is not easy to reverse. For example, when developing apps for smartphones, companies often have an initial platform in mind - IOS or Android, for example - it can be cheaper to develop for a single platform, but then more costly to offer the app on a second or third platform. Alternately, developing for two platforms at the same time is much slower than a single focus, and may require hiring specialist talent in order to write in different software languages.

## Project Management

Project management response to the HOW of the project:

How to manage the creation of a new product.
How to plan and dispatch tasks
How to get the right skills
How to manage a team
How to communicate with all the person involve in the project
How to get organized

## Product Management

Product management is the part of a project which focus on the WHY:

Why we create a product
Why the product will satisfy the customers
Why the product has its place on the market

*Arguably, product management is the WHY and the WHAT. See also

http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/6252/what-is-the-difference-between-project-and-product-management*

To return to our example of Jane and InDev, Jane is a product manager because she needs to not only deliver the overall projcet, but she needs to design and develop the product itself. The information provided by the client gives Jane and her team the idea of WHY the product is needed and WHAT it should be, but Jane needs to know HOW to turn this idea into a product that will satisfy the client. For this reason, product managers tend to have some form of technical awareness about the area that they work in. Product managers that have no idea of a given type of product - be they deckchairs, software platforms or magazines - will have a generic set of product management skills, but may not be able to fully engage with the technical problems inherent in a specific product. The focus of this lecture is this overall skillset, which will need to be combined with some form of technical understanding in order to successfully design and deliver products in the marketplace. Jane does not need to be the best software programmer in the world in order to product manage a smartphone app, but she needs to know enough about this type of product to understand the inevitable problems that will arise during the process. Jane also needs to know enough that she is able to explain the problems that her team brings to her attention and communicate them to the client in a way that manages the client's expectations about the product itself.


# Product Management with Agile - 15mn

*In this section I think we should contrast agile methods with formal pre-planning - what are the benefits of agile product management? Who is likely to resist it?*

## Agile Concepts

### Agile Manifesto

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

### Agile Principles

- Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of useful software
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
- Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
- Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
- Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
- Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
- Working software is the principal measure of progress
- Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
- S-elf-organizing teams
- Regular adaptation to changing circumstance

*What's the relationship between scrum and agile?*

Agile is iterative, meaning that the requirements for the product are subject to continuous revision. Waterfall or other more formal methods rely upon requirements that do not change very often. There are good reasons for this - in extremely complex products, such as a commercial aeroplane a change in requirements can result in teams designing incompatible components. Worse, if a team does not understand the requirements that it is changing, it may product an unsafe product. As InDev has been tasked to produce a smartphone app, and not a commercial airliner, Jane can be relatively confident that her product is not going to injure anyone. As such, Jane is therefore free to consider the benefits of iterative design. One is that this method requires Jane to do less micro-management, since her team should -in theory - adapt itself to produce the product as necessary. Furthermore, Jane's team can respond to client feedback - the client can see the product in development and react appropriately.

# Scrums and Roles (10 mns)

*Before defining scrums, I'd suggest a section that introduces it as the appropriate working method for agile, mapping that against the values explained above.*

## Definition
Scrum is a set of methods mapping the agile values. Scrum can also be seen as a framework which implement Agile principles.

Scrum is just one implementation of the agile concepts.

## Roles

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

*The   link to this section should be that we can see different requirements   in a product management cycle. We should also have exterior clients   (marketing?) included here*

## Project Manager

- The project Manager is responsible for the implementation of the project.
- She is responsible for the delivery of the product in time, cost and quality.
- She makes sure the team achieve its objectives.
- She is the logistic mind of the project and she is often compare to a Chief Operating Officer.

## Product Manager
The product manager is responsible of the reason of the project.
She has the product vision.
She is often compare to a Chief Executif Officer

*I have not heard this CEO/COO distinction before.
I find the distinction CEO/COO here: http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/product-managers-vs-project-managers/*


## Product Owner
"Product   owner" is a role widely associated with the scrum methodology. The  role  of the product owner is to ensure that the user stories agreed  with the  development team accurately reflect what the client wants and  then to  ensure that those user stories are actually delivered as  intended.

During   each sprint, they are the main (and usually the only) point of contact   between the client and the development team and their role is to give   feedback and to approve user stories as they are delivered. They are   expected to work closely with the development team at the beginning and   end of each sprint to plan and review progress towards the project   goals.


## Working Methods 10mns

### The daily scrum meeting (morning standup)

This meeting is short and is the occasion for each team member to answer three questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

If there are any problems the scrum master is here to coach the team and to give some directions.

*It  might be worth saying something about how the role of the scrum master  is applied. In some agile development teams the scrum master is just a  member of the dev team, often the lead developer. In other contexts, the  scrum master is seen more as a project manager and is often also the  person who deals with the internal politics of an organisation and the  relationship with the client. In an ideal client relationship, where the  client understands their role a product owner and the development team  is experienced enough to manage their workload autonomously, the scrum  master is an almost invisible role.*

### Personas

Define the targets for your product and understand your customers.

Personas are a way to profile your users. They can be represented as cards containing picture profile, names, hobbies, behaviors, job or others information which might help you to identify the users.

From the personas you can deduce the functionalities the product must have to respond to specific problems of users.

### Epics

Epics are important features of the product. From your personas you can deduce the epic which can respond to a user need.

### User Stories

User stories are refined epics. Split your epics into small features. It's easier to quantify time and difficulty of small features unit.

*I suggest epics go under user stories in that they are not as fundamental and are a more recent introduction. I would say something like, "On large projects with many requirements, user stories are sometimes divided up into "epics", which describe a group of related user stories".*

### Acceptance criteria and definition of done

The goal of acceptance criteria are to validate the definition of the product. Acceptance criteria are simple statements which can be understood by the client. Acceptance criteria focus on WHAT feature must be respond not on the HOW, so they are independent of the technical implementation. For example : "The user can send email" and not "When the user click on the home button the function 'mail' call the right email API"


*Careful here. User stories == acceptance criteria. And it is an important feature that user stories must be testable. That is what makes them acceptance criteria. If a user story cannot be tested by a (non-technical) user, i,e, the product owner, then they cannot form part of the acceptance criteria and will need to be re-written. ""The user can send email" is not really a good acceptance criterion. "When the user goes to the home page and clicks on the send email button, they will see a form for sending email" is probably a good user story.*

pattern: Given some precondition When I do some action Then I expect some result

### Acceptance test

Acceptance tests are an implementation of the acceptance criteria. These tests are going to validate the functionalities of the user stories. They help to validate the definition of done for a user story.

*Not sure this is clear. How about "An acceptance test is not seen by the user (or the product owner), but is a software test written by the developers, that simulates a given user story and provides an automated and repeatable check of whether an acceptance criterion is being met.*

### Wireframes

At the same time you create your User Stories, it's a good practice to create wireframes to validate the user interaction with the product

*Usually wireframe come before user stories, i.e. you create wireframes for testing with users, then once you have tested and refined the wireframes, you create user stories that describe all the expected interactions between users and the application., as represented by the wireframes.*

### Backlog

The backlog is the list of prioritized functionalities of the product.

*important distinction between sprint backlog and project backlog*

### Icebox

(Term used mostly with the tool Pivotal Tracker)
The icebox is the place where new user stories are added. The icebox is not prioritised. It help to keep the backlog clean

### Sprint
Sprints are unit time where the team develop user stories and produce a version of the product. The users stories implemented during the sprint are selected by the product owner.
Sprint usually last for one or two weeks.

*It might be worth talking about why sprints are important.
-regular interval for reviewing progress and bringing client and dev team together
-opportunity to review priorities and introduce changes to spec in a controlled way
-ensures that those changes to requirements do not interfere with daily dev team work flow*

### continuous integration and sprint review

Release your product often as possible. It's important to be able to deliver your product at each steps (sprint) of the project. This validate the stability of the product.

*continuous integration and continuous delivery are crucial to allow the product owner to be able to accept or reject user stories. If they cannot see changes in the product, then they cannot provide feedback and the scrum approach breaks down.*

The sprint review is the occasion for the team to deliver a version of the product to the client. It is also a way to know if the objectives are completed

*you should probably collect together sprint planning, sprint review and sprint retrospective.*

### Velocity and retrospective

*Not sure these two concepts belong under a single heading. In fact, I think you need to re-arrange all these headings under something like Roles/Communication/Records (or Roles/Events/Artefacts, although not sure I like that nomenclature) Anyway, use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development) as a reference.*

Velocity measures how much functionalities a team deliver in a sprint. It's one way to measure the efficiency of the team.

The retrospective is a meeting where the team try to improve their process and the product development. They try to a better way to complete their tasks.
